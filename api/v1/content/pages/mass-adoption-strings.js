    `By 2005, Argentina had reached a turning point: broadband and dial-up connections still coexisted, but the balance was already 
    shifting toward faster, always-on services. Over the next few years, broadband adoption accelerated sharply. In 2006, the 
    country surpassed one million subscribers, and by 2013 dial-up had practically vanished, with more than 6.2 million broadband 
    accounts active nationwide. This signaled the definitive end of the telephone-modem era for most homes and businesses.`

    `Meanwhile, mobile and wireless technologies were transforming the way people connected. In 2000, Movicom had introduced the 
    first mobile Internet service in Latin America, but speeds remained limited until the arrival of 3G (UMTS) in 2007. This 
    upgrade brought a noticeable improvement in browsing, email, and multimedia on mobile devices. The leap to 4G LTE in 2014 
    marked another milestone, enabling high-speed video streaming, faster downloads, and a mobile experience comparable to fixed broadband.`

    `Wi-Fi also became a defining feature of connectivity in this period. From the mid-2000s onward, wireless routers spread rapidly 
    through households, offices, and public venues such as cafés, airports, and universities. The growing popularity of laptops, 
    smartphones, and tablets made Wi-Fi not just a convenience, but an expectation, changing how and where Argentines went online.`

    `The national government played a central role in expanding Internet access and bridging the digital divide. In 2010, the 
    “Argentina Conectada” National Telecommunications Plan was launched under the leadership of ARSAT, the state-owned telecommunications 
    company. Its main initiative was the Federal Fiber Optic Network (ReFeFO), designed to connect underserved regions, 
    reduce territorial inequalities, and encourage competition by supporting cooperatives and small ISPs. By the end of the 2010-2015 
    administration, approximately 95% of the backbone network was complete.`

    `That same year, the “Conectar Igualdad” program began distributing millions of netbooks to students and teachers across the country. 
    Schools were equipped with digital classrooms, and free Internet access was provided to ensure that technology reached not only 
    urban centers but also remote communities.`

const sixthParagraph =
    `In 2014, the Argentina Digital Law (Law 27.078) was enacted, declaring the development of information and communication technologies 
    to be of public interest. The law established network neutrality, universal access, and the obligation for the national communications 
    authority (ENACOM) to set minimum Internet speeds, guaranteeing quality service for all users.`

const seventhParagraph =
    `In October 2014, Argentina launched ARSAT-1, the country’s first geostationary telecommunications satellite, 
    designed and built locally by INVAP and operated by ARSAT. This marked a historic achievement, making Argentina 
    the first Latin American nation to develop and operate its own satellite of this kind. A year later, ARSAT-2 was 
    launched, expanding coverage to the entire American continent.`
