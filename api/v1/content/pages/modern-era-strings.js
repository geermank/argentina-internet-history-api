    `By 2015, Argentina was entering a new phase in its digital evolution. Broadband connections 
    had largely replaced dial-up, but the country was now focusing on faster networks, expanded 
    infrastructure, and the integration of mobile technologies.`

const secondParagraph =
    `Fiber optic technology became the fastest-growing and most efficient way to connect. By the 
    end of 2024, around 80% of Argentine households had fixed Internet access, with fiber representing 
    roughly 40% of these connections. Between January and December 2024, 967,000 new fiber subscribers 
    were added, reaching a total of 4.8 million. The expansion of the Federal Fiber Optic Network 
    (ReFeFO) was key, connecting over 17 million Argentines across 1,129 localities.`

const thirdParagraph =
    `Mobile networks also saw major upgrades. Although 5G deployment began in 2023, the introduction 
    of Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) allowed 4G and 5G to coexist, facilitating a faster and more 
    cost-effective rollout. Telecom activated more than 240 DSS antennas in the Buenos Aires 
    Metropolitan Area (AMBA). The ultimate goal is to implement Standalone (SA) 5G networks, 
    offering higher speeds, lower latency, and greater capacity. By 2025, 5G is expected to 
    account for 7% of all mobile connections in the country.`

const fourthParagraph =
    `Wi-Fi also became increasingly prevalent. From the mid-2010s onward, wireless access spread 
    rapidly in homes, offices, cafés, airports, and universities. Laptops, smartphones, and tablets 
    made Wi-Fi essential, transforming the way Argentines access the Internet on a daily basis.`

    `Internet usage continued to rise steadily. By 2025, 90.1% of the population was online, spending 
    an average of 8 hours and 44 minutes daily on the Internet. Social media became an integral part 
    of digital life, with users spending an average of 3 hours and 5 minutes per day on these platforms. 
    The main reasons for use included keeping in touch with family and friends (56.3%), 
    reading news (49.7%), and passing free time (44.2%). Around 70.3% of the population maintained 
    social media profiles, reflecting a high level of digital penetration.`

const sixthParagraph =
    `Despite these advances, challenges remain. Internet speeds in Argentina continue to be low 
    compared to global and regional standards, both for mobile and fixed connections. 
    This highlights the ongoing need for investment in infrastructure and technology upgrades 
    to close the digital gap and strengthen the country’s competitiveness in the digital era.`
