const firstParagraph =
    `Even though our journey starts in 1994, we first have to go a bit back in time; in particular, to the year 1987, 
    when Argentina achieved a connection between its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the University of Toronto. 
    This was the country’s first international communication via e-mail, using the UUCP protocol. As a side note, 
    this connection was made possible by first communicating via telephone.`

const secondParagraph =
    `Up to this point, e-mail services were only used in the academic context, mainly by members of 
    the University of Buenos Aires and other national institutions. This was possible thanks to the RAN project 
    (Red Académica Nacional, or National Academic Network), which had begun only a year earlier, in 1986. 
    This is why the connection with the University of Toronto was such a significant milestone, 
    and it is also worth noting that Argentina was going through an important crisis following a military 
    dictatorship that had fallen only a few years before.`

const thirdParagraph =
    `Before moving forward to 1994, it is important to mention that during the previous years, 
    research in the academic context continued and other milestones were achieved. 
    In 1990, the first TCP/IP internet connection was established, marking a shift towards the modern internet protocol. 
    By 1993, the RETINA network (Red Teleinformática Académica) was created to connect all UBA faculties and other 
    academic institutions across the country using TCP/IP, with an initial connection speed of just 64 Kb.`

const fourthParagraph =
    `We finally arrive at the year 1994, when Argentina installed its first submarine fiber-optic cable, connecting the 
    city of Las Toninas to Uruguay. On April 8, the first digital connection was made. This was one of the most important 
    milestones in the history of the network in the country.`

const fifthParagrah =
    `Now, in the year 1995, another important event took place: access to the internet expanded beyond the academic field, 
    allowing commercial connections across the country. In only a few months, thousands of users (both individuals and companies) 
    were navigating a network that, on a global scale, already connected 30 million people.`

const sixthParagraph =
    `Fast forward to the year 1997, the national government declared that access to the worldwide internet for the inhabitants 
    of the Argentine Republic was a matter of national interest. This same year, Fibertel (an Argentinian ISP) started selling the first
    broadband connections.`

const seventhParagraph =
    `In 1999, the Atlantis II submarine cable is deployed, connecting Argentina and Uruguay, Brasil, Senegal, Islas Cabo Verde, España and  
    Portugal. Other submarine cables were deployed in the following years, such as SAC in 2000 and SAM 1 in 2001. `

const eighthParagraph =
    `By the year 2000, the first free ISPs appeared, such as Alternativa Gratis and Fullzero, which earned their revenue from a share of 
    the fees that users paid to telephone companies. In this way, users paid for the telephone pulses but not for a monthly dial-up 
    internet subscription, as broadband internet users did. However, even though it was a good alternative due to its low cost (especially 
    considering the difficult economic situation the country faced in the early 2000s), it had many drawbacks, particularly in terms of speed. 
    As a result, broadband connections began to rise, and by 2005 both types of technologies shared the market equally`
